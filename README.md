# Tailwind CSS Hover State Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS hover states.  The hover effect doesn't apply as expected even though the classes appear to be correctly implemented.

## Bug Description
The provided code snippet uses the `hover:bg-blue-700` class to change the background color of a div on hover. However, the expected color change does not occur. This is a common error which can be caused by a number of factors, including CSS specificity issues, conflicting styles, or incorrect class usage.

## Solution
The solution typically involves verifying the following:

1. **Correct Class Usage:** Double-check the class names for any typos.
2. **CSS Specificity:** Ensure that other CSS rules are not overriding the hover styles. Inspect the element's styles using your browser's developer tools.
3. **Parent Styles:** Review parent elements' styles for potentially conflicting rules.
4. **JavaScript Interference:** Confirm that no JavaScript code is interfering with the styles. 
5. **Tailwind Configuration:** Check if the `hover` modifier is enabled in your Tailwind configuration.
6. **CSS Order:** Ensure that your CSS is loaded in the correct order (Tailwind should typically be loaded last).
7. **Purge and rebuild**: In some cases, particularly if using PurgeCSS, a rebuild might be needed to reflect the changes. 

The solution file includes an example of how to address this issue.
